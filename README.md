	+ First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)
	+ Shortest Job First (SJF)
	+ Round Robin Scheduling (RRS)
	+ Priority Scheduling (PS)
	+ Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
	+ Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
* Reads input from `input.txt` file (FCFS, SJF, RRS, SRTF, LRTF) or `priority.txt` file (PS)
* Writes output to `output.txt` file
* Calculates average waiting time and average turnaround time
* Generates Gantt chart
